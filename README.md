## FFmpeg setup
**FFmpeg is needed for ts -> MP4 losslessly for videos. You can skip this if you don't plan to download videos.**

[Windows (gpl)](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)    
Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`    
Termux `pkg install ffmpeg`    
If you don't have root in Linux, you can have Nugs Downloader look for the binary in the same dir by setting the `useFfmpegEnvVar` option to false.
